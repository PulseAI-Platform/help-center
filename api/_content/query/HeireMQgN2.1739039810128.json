The search system can interpret this structured data and present it in a way very similar to current technologies but with significantly less compute overhead. We estimate that a pulse node can use as much as 30% less electricity as a traditional system.","_type":"markdown","_id":"content:digests.md","_source":"content","_file":"digests.md","_stem":"digests","_extension":"md"}]
